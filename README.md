Hello👋🏻
</p>



## Task and Team

This project was released by Malak, Raphael and Houcine in Holbertonschool's Bordeaux.
For this project called "Printf" we had one week to complete it. The tasks were divided equally between myself, Malak and Raphael.

## Distribution of tasks

Raphael was in charge of task 0 containing: %s and the man page.
Myself in charge of task 1 containing: %d and %i, and writing this README and the flowchart.
Malak was in charge of printf task.
Task c and s were carried out by the entire group 



This project consist of rebuilding the standard printf function in C. Our project required a function capable of printing with the %d, %c, %s, %i specifiers to standard output. _printf returns the number of characters printed. 
We were not asked to handle flag characters, field width, precision, or length.
